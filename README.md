If you're unfamiliar with Archipelago Manuals, here's the Discord server's FAQ forum channel with various introductory guides: https://discordapp.com/channels/1097532591650910289/1100290419788632074

## Setup

I'll assume you can figure out Archipelago generation, local hosting, and the Manual client from the Discord FAQs.

The part unique to Soul Reaver is how you'll manually apply the items. In this game, that means cheat codes.
On PC, the cheat codes are simply sequences of numbers that you type on the pause screen, and you'll hear a noise when the game recognizes a code.

For a typical manual randomizer game, the cheat codes you'll need/want to use are:

- 34226443 to enable all Earned Abilities / major progression items. I would enter this code as soon as you start a new save, and just try not to use the abilities you "don't have" yet.
  - Most lists of Soul Reaver cheat codes will list a code for each ability, but those codes enable the ability _and all previous abilities_. As far as I can tell, there aren't any cheat codes that let you e.g. enable Scaling Walls without also enabling Phasing and Soul Reaver.
- 31534 for Force Glyph
- 3641322 for Stone Glyph
- 2236443 for Sound Glyph
- 36432 for Water Glyph
- 4424582 for Fire Glyph
- 16122441 for Sunlight Glyph
- 342431623 for Fire Reaver

Health and energy upgrades you'll probably just ignore since there aren't fine-grained codes for those and they aren't that important during normal gameplay, but for completeness these are the best codes we do have:

- 271543 to upgrade your maximum health by "one coil", i.e. what you'd get from 5 health pieces
- 5232451 to set your maximum eldritch energy to 52, i.e. what you'd get from finding every glyph and energy artifact
- 364141 to refill health
